Long ago, in the age of 8-bit warriors, there existed a legendary game cartridge said to grant ultimate gaming prowess. However, a great curse befell it, causing glitches, distortions, and bizarre anomalies. Some say the spirit of a forgotten developer haunts the code, whispering secrets through corrupted pixels.

A mysterious ROM (ok its just super mario) has surfaced, along with a modified NES emulator to run it. The game is playable, but something is deeply wrong.

Will you be able to uncover the hidden flag within the glitched world?
